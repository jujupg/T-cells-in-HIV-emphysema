# Analysing CD4/CD8 T cell data from HIV patients with emphysema

Here, I analyse published data from a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5266287/) by Triplette et al. I perform some exploratory data analysis and apply a statistical test to assess the association of CD4/CD8 T cell ratio with emphysema severity.

This is a bar chart showing the relationship between CD4/CD8 ratios and smoking status.

This figure shows a bar chart displaying the relationship between CD4/CD8 ratios and emphysema severity. I applied a linear regression to assess the statistical significance of the association between the two variables.
